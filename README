Lighttpd2 is the new branch of lighttpd.  It is not
compatible, config-wise, with lighttpd v1.x.  This
server is meant to run int he foregreound, supervised;
thus we provide /etc/sv/lighttpd2 to make this straightforward
with runit or daemontools.  Enjoy lighty2, catch us in 
#lighttpd on freenode.
